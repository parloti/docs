# NativeScript CLI installer

## Installation

Install the latest version of NativeScript CLI and its missing prerequisites for Windows OS via an executable installer.

[Download Installer](https://www.nativescript.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/nativescript-cli-setup-wix.exe)

> **WARNING**:
> * The NativeScript Windows installer only works on machines that do not currently have an Android SDK installed. If you’re working on a machine with Android SDKs already in place, go through the manual installation steps on this page to set up NativeScript.
> * The NativeScript Windows installer can **not** be used to update existing NativeScript installations. To get the latest version of NativeScript, refer to our article on [updating your NativeScript versions](http://docs.nativescript.org/releases/upgrade-instructions).

### Prerequisites
